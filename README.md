## Design Choices
The design of WordWeaver was shaped by both user needs and accessibility principles, aiming for a visually engaging yet highly functional experience. Every design decision, from typography and colour contrast to responsiveness, was made to support ease of use, cross-device compatibility, and inclusive gameplay. This section outlines the key design systems used throughout the project, including font hierarchy, dual-theme colour palettes, minimal imagery, and mobile-first design.

### Typography
WordWeaver uses the **Poppins** typeface, a geometric sans-serif font chosen for its clean, modern appearance and excellent readability across devices. With a rounded yet structured aesthetic, Poppins helps strike a balance between playfulness and clarity - ideal for a puzzle based game.

The type system follows a responsive scale that adjusts font sizes across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices to enhance usability and maintain visual hierarchy.

|Text Style|Mobile|Tablet|Desktop|
|----------|------|------|-------|
|Page-Heading/Hero|40px|48px|64px|
|Section Heading|32px|40px|48px|
|Subheading|20px|24px|32px|
|Paragraph/Body|16px|18px|20px|
|Button/Label|18px|20px|22px|
|Caption/Tag|14px|14px|14px|
